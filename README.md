# Hello-World
doing great things with <Git>

A great man once said "Coding can make you smarter" thats what ive been trying to do ever since. They say its a hard journey to become a programmer but in my own point of view nothing is hard if you have passion, the moment you start thinking about to be a problem solver, everything will start being so meaningful to you..#1 for Coding: IF IT WORKS, DON'T TOUCH IT
